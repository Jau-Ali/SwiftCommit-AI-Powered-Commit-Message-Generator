# SwiftCommit-AI-Powered-Commit-Message-Generator-for-VSCode

SwiftCommit is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) plugin designed to automate the process of generating concise and meaningful commit messages based on code changes. This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including transformer-based and RNN-based architectures, to analyze code differences and create contextual commit summaries.

The goal is to enhance the version control workflow by providing developers with AI-generated commit messages that explain both what changed and why the changes were made. SwiftCommit is built to improve developer collaboration, documentation practices, and overall efficiency in the software development lifecycle.
